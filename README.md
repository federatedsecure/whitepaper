# Abstract

## Background and Motivation

Privacy-preserving computation (PPC) enables computation on several parties’ proprietary data that cannot be shared openly between participants. The family of technologies includes secure multiparty computation, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and others.

In practice, there are often steep barriers to entry. Small and medium enterprises, startups and individuals, research and teaching institutions lack the specific knowledge and resources to implement solutions and deploy and maintain the demanding and complex tech stacks.

Federated Secure Computing is an open-source initiative championed by Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU Munich) and funded by Stifterverband. The project aims to provide access to PPC to a larger developer audience without specialist knowledge.
